__2021 Ruby Gosu Inaugural Game Jame Arcade__

An attempt to include all the Game Jam entries in one playable Game Super-menu Foyer Lobby.

__INSTALLATION__

Gosu has prerequisites. See libgosu.org for details.

If you don't have bundler installed, then do:

gem install bundler

After that, cd into the JamArcade root folder, and run:

bundle install

This should install a bunch of small to medium sized gems from the Gemfile list.

After that, run:

main.rb



__DEPENDENCIES__
  crack
  ffi
  gosu
  rest-client

[More info to follow in the future.]


__ISSUES__

The .gitignore file seems a little bit OP.

(OP stands for over-powered.)
